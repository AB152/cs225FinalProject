# Project Development Log

- Week of 11/22/2020:
This week was Fall Break and it was the first week of our project development. During this week, we created the basic necessary files such as the Catch test suite and basic file I/O code, and we copied our OpenFlights dataset into the dataset folder of this repository. We also began talking about how to approach the implementation of our project, such as what should be nodes and edges in our graph data structure implementation. We decided on airports being the nodes, routes being the edges, and the number of stops along a route to be the edge weights.
